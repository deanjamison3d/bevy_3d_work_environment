Experimental: Project to see if it is possible to create a 3D Virtual work environment with Bevy

-------

Hello all,

I have created an experimental project to see if it is possible to create a 3D virtual work environment.

The basic features I am looking to include are the spawning and despawning of floating windows. in these windows, there could be a YouTube video playing or it could be a terminal interfacing with a remote system.

This interface is not unlike the home screen of most VR platforms.

I am admiditly a beginner in Bevy.  I will be using this project to explore what Bevy can do.
